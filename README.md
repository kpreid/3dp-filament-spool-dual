Modification of [Unlockable loose Filament Spool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1986210) which holds two filaments, thus allowing two small samples or leftovers to be held in the same volume as the original design.

## Usage

### Printing

Do not print `_Original_Fork.stl`; it is the original one-slot model, which is only included because `Filament_Spool_Dual_Fork.scad` needs it to generate the modification.

Print:

* 2 copies of `Filament_Spool_Disk.stl`.
* 5 copies of `Filament_Spool_Dual_Fork.stl`.
* 10 copies of `Filament_Spool_Spike.stl` (each fork now requires two).

Or if you are "upgrading" an existing spool of the original design, print 5 new forks and 5 spikes.

### Assembly

Same as original except for the extra spikes, but this is my writeup of the details:

1. I had to clean the filament holding holes with a 5/32" drill bit — slightly smaller would be a better close fit, but this size is usable.

2. Press two spikes onto the hexagonal posts on each fork. Note the asymmetry of the spike — one way will line up nicely with the fixed center spike and the other will not.

3. Press the assembled forks into your choice of notch in the **flat side** of the disk.

4. Put the other disk on top of the forks and press it all together.

5. Gently push each fork's two locking pins towards the hub to make sure the tabs are locked rather than still compressed by the hole.
